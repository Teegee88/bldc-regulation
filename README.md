# bldc-regulation

This project aims to have a working regulation of the BLDC motor that is on the electrotechnic's bench.

Test 1 - Provides the code to have it work

Test 2 - Is supposed to gather the data collected via the Arduino and export it to an Excel file in order to determine the constant Kp.   The idea is to connect one of the signals of the encoder and link it to an interruption pin of the Arduino.
